After doing a good bit of reading, I decided it was time to take a swing at a different style of *CMS*.

I first read about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) (which is where I'm currently hosting this blog).

There's some great info there on getting started and how to set it up.
